### Introduction

---

This is a repository to accompany the module 'An Introduction to Social Data Science', running _online_ from Monday 9th of August until Tuesday the 24th of August, inclusive. This `readme.md` file represents the "Module Handbook", and contains all of the information you need to know about the course. You should clone this repository some time around Monday the 9th of August. We'll cover topics such as; An introduction to Python, open and reproducible research, basic machine learning, natural language processing, and network science.

A quick n.b.: Even though we have nine _very full_ lectures worth of content, the speed of the class will proceed as appropriate. If things are seemingly trivial, we can likely cover all of the material, but it might be that we only cover the first 8 (i.e. until 'lecture_8's content).

### Communication

-------
* Outside of Lectures: Communication will be undertaken outside of lectures on the [Slack](https://slack.com/) platform. Please let me know if you have not recieved a Slack invitation.
* Lectures: The course will be delivered at 10am-12pm BST on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). See the Slack channel for a series of Zoom links.


### Data

-------

Later in the course we’ll use the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. **Please sign up for a copy now!** This is __IMPERATIVE!__

Further information on exactly how to do this will be posted on Slack and via Email.
### Software

---

This course is taught primarily in Python. We recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution, which is compatible with [Windows](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Windows-x86_64.exe), [Linux](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh) and [MacOS](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh) all the same. If you have problems with installation, please post on the Slack channel. the `requirements.txt` file describes all of the dependancies\libraries we will use throughout the course. Type:

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

into the clone of the repository to install them.

### Learning Objectives:

-------

Upon successful completion of this course students should:

  1.  Be able to start their own Python projects using Jupyter Notebooks and text editors.
  2.  Clean, wrangle, and visualize basic data structures.
  3.  Undertake basic predictive exercises with machine learning models (in the form of training, test, and cross-validation splits), and evaluate predictions.
  4.  Conduct basic network analysis in Python.
  5.  Undertake topic modelling, and other forms of advanced text analysis.
  6.  Understand the pipelines of, and produce reproducible social data science work.


### Assignments

---

The course will be assessed in two components.

1.  The first will be a project related to a specific part of the course. This may or may not involve the Fragile Families Child and Wellbeing Study data descrribed above. This is individual work and will contribute 75% of the mark. It should also be submitted as an `.ipynb` file.

2. The second will be a group presentation of a 'peer review', where we split into five or six groups. Presentations will be on the final day of the the class, and should be between 10-15 minutes. The objective is to introduce, describe, and critically assess an assigned public paper. It contributes 25% of the credit, and marks are awarded as either a pass (full 25%) or fail (0%).

### Schedule

-------

The course will run for ten sessions. They will begin at 10am BST, and run until about 12:00/12:10pm. Each session will have a series of exercises and a homework built into it, and at the start of each session, we will quickly review the homework from the previous day. The sessions are primarily ran out of ipython notebooks, but some will also incorporate lecture slides where appropriate. All lecture materials are structured corresponding to the day which they relate (e.g. section 4 of the 7th day is section 7.4). The schedule for the ten sessions is as follows;

 1. **An Introduction to Python: Part One.** A review of object types, control statements, file operators.
 2. **An Introduction to Python: Part Two.** A review of advanced control statements, error handling, logging, custon functions.
 3. **An Introduction to Key SDS Libraries: calcuating, visualising, scraping and more** A review of some key libraries for social data science, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib (and seaborn), requests and statsmodels.
 4. **An Introduction to Machine Learning: Part One.** From linear models to random forests and support vector machines, all using scikitlearn.
 5. **An Introduction to Machine Learning: Part Two.** Various examples, and the Fragile Families Challenge.
 6. **An Introduction to Natural Language Processing: Part One.** NLTK, categorizing and tagging words, classifying text, extracting information.
 7. **An Introduction to Natural Language Processing: Part Two.** Analysing sentence structure, feature based grammar, meaning, data structure.
 8. **An Introduction to Network Science: Part One.** Defining a network, introducing Networkx, from data to networks, communities.
 9. **An Introduction to Network Science: Part Two.** Social networks, simulations, space and time, visualisation.
 10. **Assessed peer review session** re: assignment 2, as described above.
