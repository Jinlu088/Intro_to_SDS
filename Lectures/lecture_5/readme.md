In this lecture, we'll talk about various examples of Machine Learning applications in the social sciences. One prominent example is the Fragile Families Challenge; perhaps the most famous application of predictive methods in the Social (Data) Sciences. We'll also talk about some basic code to replicate the basic models and evaluate them.
