Please see the readme.md file in the [Github repository](https://github.com/crahal/Teaching/tree/master/PythonForSociologists) for the course handbook. Please note: this module will revolve around Python 3.x, and while you can follow the examples and homeworks in a text-editor and execute the scripts via the command line, [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are advised! All important Python concepts are in bold typeface.\n",

    "We now move onto **control statements** which are absolutely critical. The first one we will consider is the _for loop_ for iterating over objects (collections) such as lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually any collection can be iterated over. Python will keep track of the elements in a collection so that each element is used only once. If a collection is unordered python will not necessarily give you the elements in the order that they were created. The ordering is actually related to how they are stored in memory and so it could change at any point. The main way to iterate through a collection is to use the infamous *for loop*. This will iteratively 'loop' through all elements of our collection, operating on them one at a time. where 'i' is the conventional iterator, try something like the following:"

    "1. First, we *absolutely need* the colon at the end of the opening line of the control statement (try without!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Secondly, note the indentation. In Python, whitespace is used to denote blocks (in other langauges, brackets or braces are used). ```def```, ```if```, ```elif```, ```else```, ```try```, ```except```, ```finally```, ```with```, ```for```, ```while```, and ```class``` all start blocks. Some of these we will see more of in this course. To end the indentation, we just 'outdent' (i.e. go back to where we were before the block began). An indent can either be 4 spaces or a tab. People have [very heated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/119562/tabs-versus-spaces-in-python-programming) discussions about [which to use](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/), but at this level, either is fine. Put simply: this indentation is how python manages what is inside a loop and what is after the loop. What happens if we dont intent, or dont include the colon?"
