Some of these we will see more of in this course. To end the indentation, we just 'outdent' (i.e. go back to where we were before the block began). An indent can either be 4 spaces or a tab. People have [very heated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/119562/tabs-versus-spaces-in-python-programming) discussions about [which to use](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/), but at this level, either is fine. Put simply: this indentation is how python manages what is inside a loop and what is after the loop. What happens if we dont intent, or dont include the colon?"
